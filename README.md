# 1x1x1x1's Entanglement Minigame

Ever wanted to play 1x1x1x1's Entanglement minigame but just couldn't be bothered to join Forsaken?
Ever wanted 1x1x1x1 to just mess you up in the middle of a game?
No? Just me?
Ok, well this program does just that, shoves the minigame straight into your desktop, forcing you to complete it before letting you do anything else with your pc.
This program also adds some unique twists to make your experience worse.

**This program is intentionally disruptive.**
Be aware of that.

## Features
- Randomized error popups
- Multi-monitor support
- Animated green static overlay
- Challenge Mode (if you're too lazy to start the minigame yourself)
- Global hotkeys
- Kill switch (in case my code sucks)

## Controls
- **F8** – Start Entanglement
- **F4** – Emergency Quit (alt+f4 works too)
- Tray icon – Restore / Quit

## Installation
1. Download the latest `.exe` from **Releases**
2. Run it
3. ???
4. Profit

## Disclaimer
This project is literally made just for the funzies.
If you do some funny shtuff with it, it ain't my fault.
Also, don't worry, this does not inject 57 horses into your personal computer, I ain't no John Doe.
